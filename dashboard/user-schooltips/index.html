        <h2>Turn Out the Lights</h2>
        <p>
            Lighting is one of the largest users of energy in the classroom. By turning out the lights when a classroom is unoccupied, the school can save money. The school may also want to consider "occupancy sensors" that detected whether there are people in the room. If no one is there, the switch turns off the light.

        <h2>Close the Doors</h2>
        <p>
            Leaving doors wide open to a room or building may make it more inviting to come in, but it wastes energy. Don't prop doors open but allow them to close after people walk through the doorway.

        <h2>Change the Settings</h2>
        <p>
            Change the thermostat settings in rooms to 25 degrees during warmer months and 20 degrees during cooler months. Doing so will lower the heating and air conditioning use.
