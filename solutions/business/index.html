            Imagine if 40% of your electricity cost disappeared off the next monthly utility bill, how sweet would it sound? Places with busy commercial activities, such as retail chain stores, hotels, building offices, and factories, usually consume a vast amount of electricity which can be extremely pricey. At the end of each month, business owners and system operators receive a notable electricity bill from their utility company, and they pay whatever is owed thinking that it is perfectly economical and reasonable. However, in fact, they might have been charged a lot more than what is actually used. Why...?

            The real problems stay hidden and are happening in everyday business operation, ranging from unsuitable electricity contract, aged and ineffectual machine application, facility abnormality, and inefficient use of power. Realizing these issues, Power Tracker combines power meters, communication gateways, and a cloud computing platform to provide efficiency diagnosis, helping system operators to simultaneously monitor complex power consumption for different business models. Our focuses are to reduce potential electricity wastage, maximize system outputs, and create more cost-effective power management while preventing fatal accidents from occurring.
