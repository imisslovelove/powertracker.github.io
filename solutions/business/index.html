            Imagine if 40% of your electricity cost disappeared off the next monthly utility bill, how sweet would it sound? Places with busy commercial activities, such as retail chain stores, hotels, building offices, and factories, usually consume a vast amount of electricity which can be extremely costly. At the end of each month, business owners and system operators receive a notable electricity bill from their utility company, and they pay whatever is owed thinking that it is perfectly economical and reasonable. However, in fact, they might have been charged a lot more than what is actually used. Why...?
